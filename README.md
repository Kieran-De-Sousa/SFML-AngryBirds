# SFML-AngryBirds
Angry Birds was the culmination of all the different aspects and skills I had picked up from my previous worksheet game projects. Going for an object-oriented programming approach and highly maintainable code structure, this game is a great illustration of the knowledge I obtained in “Games in C++” regarding approaches to code structuring.
